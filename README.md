- **User Stories**: Defined user stories using Agile methodologies, ensuring clear communication of requirements and priorities.
- **Test Cases**: Documented test cases for each user story, outlining test scenarios, preconditions, steps, and expected results.

### Continuous Integration and Deployment

- **Version Control**: Leveraged Git for version control, allowing seamless collaboration, code review, and version management.
- **Continuous Integration**: Utilized Jenkins for automated builds and continuous integration, ensuring that code changes were tested and integrated regularly.
- **Deployment Automation**: Implemented deployment scripts using Docker and Kubernetes for efficient and consistent deployment across different environments.

## Efficient Team Management

Effective team management was essential to the success of the project, ensuring that tasks were assigned, progress was tracked, and issues were addressed promptly.

### Task Management

- **Agile Methodologies**: Adopted Agile practices, including daily stand-up meetings, sprint planning, and retrospective meetings, to manage tasks and adapt to changing requirements.
- **Issue Tracking**: Utilized project management tools such as Jira or Trello to track tasks, user stories, and bugs throughout the development lifecycle.

### Communication

- **Regular Meetings**: Scheduled regular team meetings to discuss progress, resolve issues, and align on priorities.
- **Slack Channels**: Maintained dedicated Slack channels for real-time communication and quick collaboration among team members.

## Deployment Architecture

The Patient Tracker Application is deployed using a scalable and secure architecture, ensuring high availability and reliability in production environments.

### Infrastructure

- **Cloud Hosting**: Deployed the application on cloud infrastructure (e.g., Azure, Google Cloud) for scalability and flexibility.
- **Load Balancing**: Utilized load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application for optimal performance.

### Security
